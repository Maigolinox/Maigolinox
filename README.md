I am a technotronic engineer and I am about to finish a degree in software development (1 year to go), I love technology, mathematics and developing software is one of my hobbies.
Since I was 15 years old I was interested in technological development, experimenting I learned to repair computers; I have enrolled in courses to learn to develop applications 
and web pages with different tools and frameworks complementing the topics I learned at university.

In a certain way I have taken personal projects to develop applications for mobile devices,however, I still have not mastered it in its entirety so I am putting a lot
of effort and commitment with my learning to become a developer of applications for mobile devices of different operating systems One of my latest projects has been developing
applications and web platforms for my university (specifically in the development of the registration platform for graduate applicants).

I have both work and academic experience leading teams, I love taking control of the situation because I create different paths that can help me solve a situation and as the
situation develops, make decisions to reduce the risk of failing in achieving my goal. . I like to take risk when it is controlled and I try to keep the situation under control,
I take into account different opinions to approach the problem from different perspectives.

I have been a candidate to participate in different scholarships from Santander Mexico and fortunately I won a scholarship to study data science in a course taught by the 
company BEDU, from where I learned the databases of data science, the development of applications with R, the use of Python to analyze, clean and manipulate information, 
the objective of the course is to give us the solid foundations to be able to develop data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

In the same way I am about to take an exam to obtain the Six Sigma green belt certification.
For me the most important thing in my life is to never stop developing my knowledge, I want to go as far as my decisions and actions allow me, I want to continue growing
and being at the forefront of technological development responsibly with the environment, but above all I want to leave a mark on my environment, gain recognition for the
contribution I make to humanity creating economic and social well-being for the whole world if I have the possibility.
I have plans to create my entrepreneurships, to create well-being for people who join their efforts to my causes, to make people realize that creating a better world is
within our possibilities and make it clear that it is up to us to create a change, to assume the responsibility of our circumstances.

I firmly believe that the least we should waste is time, our lives are short, but in my life I want to do the best that I can do and do it well by giving my best effort in 
the things I believe in.
