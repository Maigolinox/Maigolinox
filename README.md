## Python Developer | Software Engineer | Project Manager

Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Software Engineering, I bring a diverse skill set and a commitment to innovation in software development. My educational background in Mechatronics Engineering, combined with extensive experience in Python development and artificial intelligence, positions me to contribute effectively to cutting-edge projects.

I've honed my project management skills through the Google Specialization on Coursera, delving into everything from project initiation to agile methodologies. Additionally, my knowledge extends to essential DevOps practices, KanBan system design, SCRUM foundations, and more, all supported by certifications from reputable institutions like Oracle and CertiProf.

My academic background is complemented by hands-on experience showcased in my GitHub repositories. Whether it's developing platforms for automating work product analysis with AI, crafting Django applications, or delving into natural language processing algorithms for opinion classification, I'm constantly exploring new horizons.

You'll find a range of projects on my profile, from bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis to web development portfolios and IoT system deployments on AWS EC2. I also curate resources for learning Linux, data science with Python and R, and algebraic concepts in R.

Join me on this journey of exploration and innovation as we continue to push the boundaries of technology together. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me for collaborations or discussions on all things software engineering and beyond! ðŸš€
