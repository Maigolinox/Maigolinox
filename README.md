Hello, my name is Victor Terron.
I am a technotronic engineer, I love technology, mathematics and programming.

I have enrolled in courses to learn Web Development, analyze data with python and R (also graph it) or programming scripts to automate task like web scrappers also one of my majors is develop IoT systems using MCU's like ESP32, PIC and arduino with a real server that in the background has my own private broker to control and monitoring some variables like on/off of lights or any other device, monitoring temperature, register and control the access in a DB using MySQL.

In a certain way I have taken personal projects to develop applications for mobile devices,however, I still have not mastered it in its entirety so I am putting a lot of effort and commitment with my learning to become a developer of applications for mobile devices of different operating systems One of my latest projects has been developing applications and web platforms for my university (specifically in the development of the registration platform for graduate applicants).

I have both work and academic experience leading teams, I love taking control of the situation because I create different paths that can help me solve a situation and as the situation requires, make decisions to reduce the risk of failing in achieving my goal. I like to take risk when it is controlled and I try to keep the situation under control, I consider every opinion of my team to approach the problem from different perspectives.

I have been a candidate to participate in different scholarships from Santander Mexico and fortunately I won a scholarship to study data science in a course taught by BEDU, from where I learned the foundations of data science.

In the same way I get the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification.
For me the most important thing in my life is to never stop developing my knowledge, I want to go as far as my decisions and actions allow me, I want to continue growing and being at the forefront of technological development and make a great contribution able to create economic and social well-being for my environment.

I have plans to create my entrepreneurships, in that way I think that I be able to create well-being for people who join their efforts to my causes, to make people realize that creating a better world is within our possibilities and make it clear that it is up to us to create a change, to assume the responsibility of our circumstances.

To see my advances an projects: --------------.----------
